This is the code examples for the talk `React Virtualized: What, Why, How` given at ReactNYC on September 6th, 2018.

### Installation Instructions

* requires node version 10
* requires yarn `brew install yarn`

Terminal Window 1: `yarn start`

Terminal Window 2: `npm run catabase`

### Run through instructions

The demo goes through three files:

1. App.js
2. AppVirtualized.js
3. AppVirtualizedWindowScroller.js

Update `index.js` with the appropriate file to play around with each version. Comments are inline to explain what each of the props do and why they are important.

For best results with showing how bad the start forward method is turn on performance throttling.
